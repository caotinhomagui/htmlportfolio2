<h1>About our stay</h1>

<h2> Our routine </h2>
<p> - Caotinho Magui is a family stay, where a couple (Maiara and Guilherme) and a granny (Ana - which has your furry baby as her grandson´s) live and make the coziest place for your pet to stay in Portugal. </p>
<p> - We live in a house that has enough outdoor area for them to play the whole day, but equally cozy interior for them to rest the whole day if they desire to. Although they have access to the whole house, they also have a bedroom with direct access to the backyard, monitored by cameras and space for them to play on raining days.</p>
<p> - We have more than 3 years of experience petsitting, and we´ve taken care of more than 100 dogs, which we are proud to say keep returning month after month and year after year.</p>
<p> - We know you will miss your furry friend a lot, so we make daily videos/stories on our Instagram, so you can see how happy your dog is with his friends or how spoiled he is by sleeping on the bed with us </p>
<p> - Your pet will go out for necessities around 4 or 5 times a day, this helps your pet being reliefed always and also keep our space clean.  </p>
<p> - We have a low limit of how many dogs stay in our house, but we will also welcome a few of our furry friends from day care </p>


<h2> Behavioral assessment visit:</h2>
<p> - We know how difficult it is to find a space to trust your pet while you need a few days of vacation or even a few hours while you are at work and we are sure you would like to visit our space first to make sure it suits your pet´s needs, because of that, before booking any pet in our agenda, we receive visits on our space
to make sure we are selecting the pet´s that fit our routine and pass the behavioral assesstement, such as being friendly with the other dogs.
