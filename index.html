    <hr>

<p> We all start somewhere, and I want to guide you along not only my successfull and good looking professional website, but I also want to use this space to document even the 1st exercise in the journey of learning HTML.</p>
   
    <h3><a href="./public/movieranking.html">The movie ranking project</a></h3>

<p> The very first attempt of using HTML started simple, with a basic knowledge of: Heading element, paragraph, Break and Horizontal as void elements. With that, a movie raking exercise was completed:</p>

<h3> <a href="./public/birthdayinvite.html">The Birthday invitation exercise </a> </h3>

<p> On the next exercise, I´ve practiced further knowledge: List element (ol and ul), nesting and indetation (nesting several elements inside another), anchor element(Href) and Image element. My proud moment here was really practicing the nesting and indentation of the list and making it more complex than the exercise required. <p>And just like that, the Birthday project was completed:</p></p>

    <h3><a href="./index.html">HTML Portfolio Project</h3></a> 
    Currently writing this which feels like a moment to enjoy. A structure that is starting to come together, although not styled at all...  
    Using all previous knowledge, but also with Height attribution to the image element, File path (./ and ../) and a HTML boilerplate.
