<h3> 50 first dates </h3>
<p> I´ve always enjoyed the category "Sessão da tarde" as we call it in Brasil, and this is one I remember watching at least 50 times.</p>

<h3> CrossRoads</h3>
<p> I was just a girly 8 year old kid that would dream on living a road trip with friends, just like on this movie + it has Britney Spears in early 2000, I mean... Who didn´t want to be her?</p>

<h3> Notebook</h3>
<p> As girly as it can be, a romance with happy ending</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p> Of course. </p>

<h3>Narnia</h3>
<p> Following the adventure, the magical and drama theme </p>
